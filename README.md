# Rich-Web Lab 1 Problem Sheet
For problem 3, I have changed all the pictures to dogs images. I changed the background color to blue and set the angle to be flipped 180Â°. I changed the clickable links that appear whenever you search for something to "click me" by using the getElementsByClassName. And, I changed the paragraphs background colour to blue.
